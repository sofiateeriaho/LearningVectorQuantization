## Learning Vector Quantization

University course assignment to model a supervised classification algorithm LVQ in Matlab

[`lvqdata.csv`](lvqdata.csv) is the dataset used, conatining 100 two-dimensional feature vectors, 50% belonging to class 1 and 50% to class 2. 

There are two different implementations the first [`LVQ_a.m`](LVQ_a.m) using 1 prototype to model each class and second [`LVQ_b.m`](LVQ_b.m) using 2 prototypes per class
